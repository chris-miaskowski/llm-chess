# LLM-Powered Chess Teacher

## About the Project

This project is an innovative, AI-powered chess game designed to serve as an interactive chess teacher. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), this application offers a unique learning experience for chess players of all levels. 

What makes this project special is that approximately 95% of the code was implemented using the KODU.AI VSCode extension, showcasing the potential of  AI-assisted development in creating complex, educational applications.

2. Go to settings and insert your OpenAI key as well as Assistant ID
3. Choose your preferred game mode and difficulty level
4. Make your moves by clicking on the piece you want to move and then clicking on the destination square
5. The AI will respond with its move and provide explanations or teaching points
6. Learn from the AI's insights and improve your chess skills as you play!

## Educational Potential

This LLM-powered chess teacher has significant potential in educational settings:

- Personalized learning: Adapts to each student's skill level
- Immediate feedback: Provides real-time analysis of moves
- Conceptual understanding: Explains the reasoning behind moves and strategies
- Engaging format: Combines gameplay with learning for increased engagement
- Accessibility: Available anytime, anywhere with an internet connection

## Technical Implementation

This project demonstrates the capabilities of AI-assisted development:

- 95% of the code was generated and implemented using the KODU.AI VSCode extension
- Integrates advanced LLM technology for game analysis and teaching
- Combines React for the frontend with a robust backend for AI processing

## Future Developments

We envision expanding this project to include:
